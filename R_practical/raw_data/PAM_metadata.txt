PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulated fluorometry) data from the "coral heat-stress" experiment.

Data generated by Giulia Puntin. 
Measuremets taken between 21.06.2021 and the 21.06.2021 @ the "Amazing Coral Reaserch" facility (Wonderland). 
Instrument: PAM-2500 (Walz, Germany) with 5 mm diameter fiber optic.

RAW DATA from PAM was previously re-arranged to be tabular (see R script "tidyPAM.R"). This rearranged data (values were not changed, only their position) in now contained in 4 .csv files named "pam_1.csv", "pam_2.csv", "pam_3.csv", "pam_4.csv".
These files contain the following variables:
- "ID" : coral fragment unique ID, compose of 3 letters indicating the genera and starting with capita letter + a sequential number (max 2 digits) 
- "Date": date of the measurement, format dd.mm.yyyy
- "Time" : time of the measurement, format hh.mm.ss
- "Fo" : minimum F in dark (in light this correspond to "F")
- "Fm" : max F in dark (in light this correspond to "Fm'")
- "FvFm" : Maximum photochemical efficiency in dark (in light this corresponds to Effective photosynthetic efficiency: ΔF/Fm') 

The file "IDTT.csv" contains additional info as such:
- "ID" : coral fragment unique ID (same as above for pam_x.csv)
- "trtm" : treatment, can be either "C" for control or "T" for temperature treatment
- "tank" : tank in which the corals were kept (same fragment alsways in the same tank). Six possible values: "C1", "C2", "C3", "T1", "T2", "T3".

Data structure and replication: (see figure "Replication.png")
- 3 species: "Acr" = Acropora sp, "Poc" = Pocillopora sp, "Sty" = Sthylophora sp.
- 2 treatments: "C" = control temperature (= 26 C), "T" = temperature treatment (= corals exposed to 32 C for 24 h)
- 3 tanks per sp per treatment: "C1", "C2", "C3", "T1", "T2", "T3"
- 7 biological replicates (fragments) per species per tank (i.e. 7 Acr fragments in C1, 7 in C2, 7 in C3 and so on)
  = totla of 126 fragments (n = 42 per species)
- 2 technical preplications: each fragment measured twice in "Light" (on day1 and day2) and twice "Dark" conditions (on day1 and day2), where "Light" = during daylight; "Dark" = during night time. Therefore the total number of readings is 126 * 2 * 2 = 504.

Deatails of measuremets: 
- fiber optic cable fitted with transparent tube to keep a constant distance from the coral surface, cut diagonally to keep a 45˚ angle with the coral surface;
- measuremets taken 2 cm away from the tip of the coral. If no clear tip (e.g. round-ish shaped fragment), then measurement was taken in a smooth part as near as possible to the center of the fragment;
- each fragment was measured only once, unless necessary to repeat the measurement for external reasosns (e.g. battery was low, bad placement of the probe ...). 
- Effective photosynthetic efficiency (ΔF/Fm') was measured during daytime;
- Maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) was measured after 40 min from the sunset (which occurs at 18:20).



Note that the PAM machine outputs the readings as "F", "Fm'", "Y(II)". This is correct for the "Light" measurements, but needs to be changed to "Fo", "Fm", "Fv/Fm" respectively for the "Dark" measurements.

Notes from PAM measurements:
- all corals survived the treatment and were therefore PAM-ed
- although some looked paler (especially in the temperature treatment) - for more details see "color.csv".
- Sty34 in Light on day 1 (21.06.2021): probe was wrongly placed during measurement so we had to repeat the reading. We called it "Sty34b" and this is the one to keep (discard the "Sty34b" that was done first).
